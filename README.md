### 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a researcher specializing in **Uncertainty Quantification** with a focus on applying advanced statistical methods to complex physical systems. My work bridges the gap between machine learning and computational physics, aiming to improve the reliability of simulations in fluid dynamics and other state-space models.

Currently, I am working on [mention current project, e.g., a paper on particle flow filters or diffusion models].

### 🔬 Research Interests

My primary research focuses on the intersection of Bayesian inference and dynamical systems:

* **Bayesian Filtering & Smoothing:** Developing advanced filtering techniques (e.g., Particle Flow Filters, EnSF) for high-dimensional state estimation.
* **Data Assimilation:** Integrating observational data into computational models to improve forecast accuracy.
* **Scientific Machine Learning:** utilizing diffusion models and MCMC methods to solve inverse problems.
* **Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD):** Investigating transient effects and flow stability (e.g., Kolmogorov flow).
